## Project Overview

This project is explored to explaining the behavior of machine learning classifiers (or models) by interpreting their predictions. For this, we utilize a package called **LIME** (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations).

#### What is LIME?
- **Local**: LIME creates a localized neighborhood around each instance to generate explanations specific to that instance.
- **Interpretable**: The explanations are designed to be easily understandable by humans.
- **Model-Agnostic**: LIME can be applied to any model, regardless of its underlying structure.
- **Explanations**: LIME provides insights that help in understanding model behavior and interpreting predictions.
